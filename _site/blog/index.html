                         <h1>"Steve Jobs would never have done that"<span> &mdash; September 25</span></h1>
                    </a>
                    <p><p>I wish I had a penny for every time I&#39;ve heard this. I might hold Apple in a higher esteem than some people nowadays, but I think that even objectively, this is totally nonsensical.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost comical to see people make a confident statement about Steve as if they knew the man and his intentions. All we&#39;ve ever been able to do is infer his intentions and this doesn&#39;t change now that he&#39;s not around anymore.</p>

<p>Just remember that it was under Steve&#39;s leadership that Apple shipped the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/03/say-hello-to-the-motorola-e790-apple-itunes-phone/">iTunes Phone</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2004/10/26/u2-themed-ipod-now-available/">U2-themed iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/28/ipod-hi-fi-brings-music-to-the-masses/">iPod Hi-Fi</a> and many other unconventional products that would have, had they been released today, been considered to have deviated from Steve Job&#39;s precedents. Also, factor in the fact that Apple would still have evolved had Steve Jobs remained the CEO.</p>

<p>I think people are searching for something that doesn&#39;t actually exist - Apple is executing its roadmap and changing marginally along the way. There things that definitely have changed in terms of operations (such as payment of dividends to investors and Mac production in the USA), but people are not approaching things from that angle anyway.</p>

<p>All the &quot;Steve Jobs would never have done that&quot; talk is just an implicit stab at Apple that, for some reason, everyone seems to want to make at the moment.</p>

                         <h1>iOS proves itself again<span> &mdash; September 25</span></h1>
                    </a>
                    <p><p>Say what you want about iOS&#39;s new interface, but there&#39;s no denying that the most radical update ever made to the OS has only come to once again prove the strength of the ecosystem and developer community.</p>

<p>The fact that many mainstream apps (Facebook, Twitter, Evernote) along with many others have already been updated with fresh interfaces that abide by the new design guidelines really showcases both the quality of the tools offered by Apple and the dedication of developers to reflecting that quality in their apps.</p>

<p>This is in stark contrast to when a similar thing happened on Android when Ice Cream Sandwich was introduced almost two years ago. Google did introduce rigorous design guidelines but it was a long time before they had manifested in a substantial amount of apps. The situation is, admittedly, slightly more arbitrary on Android given its tremendous version fragmentation (around 30% of devices are still running a version from three years ago) and form factor range, but I think this is still principally quite interesting to observe.</p>

<p>But on iOS, I suppose it&#39;s not too unanticipated though, developers on the platform have already proven their commitment through rebuilding their apps for the iPad when it launched and updating their apps for the larger screen for iPhone 5. At both of those points in time, there were concerns about a possible eruption of fragmentation - but such never materialised because it was masked by extraordinary developer adoption.</p>

<p>Android might still be a more all-encompassing ecosystem, but iOS wins hand down on the quality front. This makes for a stable and strong ecosystem.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p><p>Hi, I&#39;m Raffi Maurer. I was once a budding young tech blogger on a little blog called Raffi&#39;s iDeas about three years ago. This is my new home on the web.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as a journal for thoughts on tech and design and an expression platform for my ideas and analysis. Feel free to follow along as I (hopefully) build up the content on the site.</p>

<p>For those geeks among you, this site is built on Jekyll (Ruby rocks!) and is hosted publicly on my GitHub profile. Feel free to poke around in the repository and critique my amateurish code. I&#39;ve also really enjoyed using Sass to style the site and more or less can&#39;t imagine life without Git.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s perfect, I&#39;m certainly not, so constructive criticism is more than appreciated and the odd compliment is likely to stroke my ego enough to compel me to continue.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
