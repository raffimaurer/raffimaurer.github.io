        <h1>"Steve Jobs would never have done that"<span> &mdash; September 25</span></h1>
        <p><p>I wish I had a penny for every time I&#39;ve heard this. I might hold Apple in a higher esteem than some people nowadays, but I think that even objectively, this is totally nonsensical.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost comical to see people make a confident statement about Steve as if they knew the man and his intentions. All we&#39;ve ever been able to do is infer his intentions and this doesn&#39;t change now that he&#39;s not around anymore.</p>

<p>Just remember that it was under Steve&#39;s leadership that Apple shipped the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/07/03/say-hello-to-the-motorola-e790-apple-itunes-phone/">iTunes Phone</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2004/10/26/u2-themed-ipod-now-available/">U2-themed iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/28/ipod-hi-fi-brings-music-to-the-masses/">iPod Hi-Fi</a> and many other unconventional products that would have, had they been released today, been considered to have deviated from Steve Job&#39;s precedents. Also, factor in the fact that Apple would still have evolved had Steve Jobs remained the CEO.</p>

<p>I think people are searching for something that doesn&#39;t actually exist - Apple is executing its roadmap and changing marginally along the way. There things that definitely have changed in terms of operations (such as payment of dividends to investors and Mac production in the USA), but people are not approaching things from that angle anyway.</p>

<p>All the &quot;Steve Jobs would never have done that&quot; talk is just an implicit stab at Apple that, for some reason, everyone seems to want to make at the moment.</p>
