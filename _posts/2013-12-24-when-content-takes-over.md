title: When Content Takes Over

I love the internet. It provides content consumption on a level that mankind has never before experienced - one that can evolve and expand. It's like a newspaper that can be changed after going to print.

The internet allows us to discover more content than any other content medium ever known to mankind. The amount of information it encompasses is almost unquantifiably large, leaving us as the consumers inundated with things to read, watch and hear. But from the outset, the internet is fulfilling it’s purpose. It was invented not as an application runtime as many use it today, rather it’s purpose was to serve as a universally accessible network of documents.

But though the scale of the internet has grown tremendously, our capacity to assimilate information is still on the same level as it was when newspapers and the like were our primary sources of information. Our content has superseded our ability to take it in.

## A solution
So, naturally, we’ve invented ways of regulating and selecting the types of content and the subject matters that we consume. Using online services (the trendy service nowadays being Twitter), we are able to curate streams of content by connecting with interests and individuals. We have huge social networks which are all, at their baseline, giant curation tools that allow us to pick and choose our content and devour it at our will.

## A metacontextual problem 
But these self-curation platform themselves present precisely the problem they set out to solve, albeit on a subordinate level. Logging into a service like Facebook where I’m connected with hundreds of people, I find myself once again overwhelmed by content, much of which I’m not particularly interested in, and the vast majority of which contains little value.

So to solve the overwhelming nature of content on the large scale networks, we’ve been slowly adopting the use of ‘niche’ social networks that target a specific audience with a particular type of content. Examples are Vine and Instagram which, not too unexpectedly, are owned by larger social networks Twitter and Facebook respectively. These networks give us a bare-bones experience that focuses on conveying content, as opposed to being a social layer for all of our interactions on the internet, as is the case with larger social networks.
