Hi, my name is Raffi Maurer. Some of you may remember me as a young blogger who ran a tech site called Raffi’s iDeas a couple years back. I ended the site in 2011, but indicated that there would come a day when I would be ready to return to the tech blogging space. That day has now come.

Let me take this opportunity to welcome you to my new site, and blog. This blog will serve as a journal for thoughts on tech and design, as well as a medium of expression for my ideas and analysis. I do hope that you follow along as I build up the content and help me make this project a success. I’ve spent a few months hammering away at my own simplistic and responsive WordPress theme and I hope flat design fanatics will appreciate what is my first ever web design project.

I’m only fifteen, and one of the youngest tech bloggers out there, so constructive criticism is more than appreciated and the odd compliment is likely to stroke my ego enough to compel me to continue. I can’t say how often I’ll post, or what the posts will be about – but expect a mixture of opinion, analysis and raw ideas, articulated in the highest degree of eloquence I am capable of. I hope you enjoy reading and help push my writing out across the globe; and I thank you all in advance for your support.
