The arrival of iOS 7 has undoubtedly brought about a new era of design at Apple. The new design philosophy communicated through iOS 7 is definitely an expression of a new direction for the company in general - something that Jony Ive himself alluded to in the promotional video for iOS 7.

But due the aesthetic redefinition of the company being so sweeping, Apple now sits in an interesting position in terms of design. It is now in a major transition period and this is slightly awkward.

The new iOS user interface is only the beginning of a transition that will probably take a few years. Apple will take time to fully establish the new design direction across its multiple product lines but in the interim, we're left with an almost bizarre jumble of 	contrary aesthetic elements spread across Apple's various product lines.

In practice, this is already evident in many places. Supposedly, the greatest manifestation of this issue is in the fact that OS X is still laden with faux aluminium and detailed 3D icons that directly contradict the design principles instated in iOS 7. It is probable that OS X will itself see a visual overhaul itself in the near future, but for now

The two simply don't look quite right alongside one another.
