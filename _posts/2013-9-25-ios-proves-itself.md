Say what you want about iOS's new interface, but there's no denying that the most radical update ever made to the OS has only come to once again prove the strength of the ecosystem and developer community.

The fact that many mainstream apps (Facebook, Twitter, Evernote)   along with many others have already been updated with fresh interfaces that abide by the new design guidelines really showcases both the quality of the tools offered by Apple and the dedication of developers to reflecting that quality in their apps.

This is in stark contrast to when a similar thing happened on Android when Ice Cream Sandwich was introduced almost two years ago. Google did introduce rigorous design guidelines but it was long time before they had manifested in a substantial amount of apps. The situation is, admittedly, slightly more arbitrary on Android given its tremendous version fragmentation (around 30% of devices are still running a version from three years ago) and form factor range, but I think this is still principally quite interesting to observe.

But on iOS, I suppose it's not too unanticipated though, developers on the platform have already proven their commitment through rebuilding their apps for the iPad when it launched and updating their apps for the larger screen for iPhone 5. At both of those points in time, there were concerns about a possible eruption of fragmentation - but such never materialised because it was masked by extraordinary developer adoption.

Android might still be a more all-encompassing ecosystem, but iOS wins down on the quality front. This makes for a stable and strong ecosystem.
