There is no element of surprise in the direction that Apple took in re-branding the 9.7” iPad as the iPad Air; the name definitely helps to give the device some extra prestige and attraction setting itself apart from the cheaper iPad Mini.

The iPad Mini was undoubtedly the star of last year’s lineup and it was evidently drawing quite a lot of attention away from the full-size iPad which remained somewhat neglected. A large proportion of prospective iPad buyers were now interested in the Mini due to it’s sleek design and lower price, but the full-size model remained differentiated through the retina display and faster processor.

This time round, things are different. Both now have a retina display. Both contain the same processor. Both have the same sleek, thin enclosure. Apple now relies on the “Air” moniker to differentiate the 9.7” model from the 7”.

There is little significance in the “Air” label as both the iPad Air and the Mini share a similar weight and have identical 7.5mm thickness. I imagine the intention of the name is to evoke an air of prestige and to attract a degree of attention back towards the full-size model. It doesn't appear to correlate specifically to any actual features of the device. 
The success of the MacBook Air has given the name “Air” intrinsic value that Apple is now leveraging for the iPad.

An alternate theory is that the Air’s name is an implication that there will at some point be other devices in the iPad line - most likely a Pro device - that would leave the product line highly consistent with the MacBook line.
