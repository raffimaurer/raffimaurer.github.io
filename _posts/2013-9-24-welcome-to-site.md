Hi, I'm Raffi Maurer. I was once a budding young tech blogger on a little blog called Raffi's iDeas about three years ago. This is my new home on the web.

This blog will serve as a journal for thoughts on tech and design and an expression platform for my ideas and analysis. Feel free to follow along as I (hopefully) build up the content on the site.

For those geeks among you, this site is built on Jekyll (Ruby rocks!) and is hosted publicly on my GitHub profile. Feel free to poke around in the repository and critique my amateurish code. I've also really enjoyed using Sass to style the site and more or less can't imagine life without Git.

Nobody's perfect, I'm certainly not, so constructive criticism is more than appreciated and the odd compliment is likely to stroke my ego enough to compel me to continue.

Cheers!
