# Welcome, code fellows!
This repository contains the source code for my personal site, [http://raffimaurer.com] (RaffiMaurer.com). This site is my platform for expression in writing, design and code; it’s my home on the web.

## Main features
- [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/raffimaurer/raffimaurer.github.io/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) contains my local development workflow for compiling Sass, concatenating + minifying CSS and outputting static pages with Jekyll. This is something that I’m constantly refining and it’s already making my development process far smoother.
- The [CSS assets directory](https://github.com/raffimaurer/raffimaurer.github.io/tree/master/assets/css) contains uncompiled Sass which is later compiled and minified.
